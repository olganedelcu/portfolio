## About Me

> I’m a community-minded engineer who combines the best of both communication and technical skills, bringing experience both from the engineering side and the business world.

I am proficient in a vast array of technologies such as JavaScript, React.js, Redux, TypeScript, Node.js, HTML/CSS, Styled Components, SASS, and REST APIs.

Not content just to be a “code monkey”, I aim to lift the whole team up and be proactive in sharing knowledge through COPs, ERGs, and thorough technical documentation. My engineering interests primarily lie in frontend frameworks, web standards, accessibility/A11y, and Clean Code.

My passion for programming ignited early in high school, where I developed my first fully functional website. Since 2019, I have been pursuing software development professionally and thrive in agile, iterative environments. Now, almost 5 years later, I am still thrilled every day to dive into code and collaborate on tickets with my engineering and product colleagues.

Personality-wise I am very open and friendly. I am good with people and at turning technical concepts into easy-to-digest information for people of all levels. When not coding, I enjoy going for a run, dancing, and reading about the latest technologies ✌️
